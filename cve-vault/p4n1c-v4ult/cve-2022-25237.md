# CVE-2022-25237

&#x20;Bonita Web 2021.2 - Remote Code Execution - API

<mark style="color:green;">**HTB - Meerkat**</mark>

Is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.

Score: <mark style="color:red;">**`9.8`**</mark>
